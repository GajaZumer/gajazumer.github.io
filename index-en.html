                <p>After getting my Bachelor's degree in Mathematics at the Faculty of Mathematics and Physics in Ljubljana, I proceeded to pursue my Master's degree at the Faculty of Electrical Engineering at the Robotics department.
                During this time, I gained experience working as a roboticist at Revoz (a wholly owned Renault subsidiary) and as an robotic application developer and organiser of the Days of Industrial Robotics event. 
                I became fascinated with virtual reality, which motivated me to pursue a Master's degree in this area.<br><br>
                After my studies, I secured a position as the head of the newly established Laboratory for Digital Technologies at the SiEVA research center. The laboratory's primary objective is to 
                facilitate and guide companies from the automotive industry in the adoption of XR technologies within their production and work processes. We serve as a central hub that connects companies, 
                faculties, and hardware and software suppliers while also promoting and enhancing knowledge across all three verticals.</p>

        VR applications covering different elements of the manufacturing and business process.
        Demo applications are developed in the Unity game engine and are compatible with the Valve Index VR headset:<br><br>

        XR hardware (Oculus Quest 2, Valve Index, Hololens 2, etc.), and practical project work on the computer, participants learned:<br><br>

            The participants were tasked with developing a simple AR game, requiring them to design and set up two distinct scenes: a lobby where the user could select their hero, and a game loop. They had to develop logic to scroll through various heroes and create a transition between scenes. Furthermore, they had to incorporate player movement and action buttons, use premade animations (such as those found in Mixamo or a part of Unity asset), and create custom animations for the coin and chest. Additionally, they were required to include a score counter and a timer to determine the end of the game loop.

            This video displays a compilation of final projects developed by the participants of the 2022 workshop. The project required the participants to create a VR game, which involved setting up a scene with multiple targets and a functional firearm. Additionally, they were encouraged to animate the targets and incorporate a particle system that would activate when a target was successfully hit. To complete the project, the participants had to implement a timer that signaled the end of the game.

        <p>In 2022, I was invited to deliver a lecture at the NTF, where I discussed the fundamentals of XR and presented real-world examples of its applications in the automotive industry. Furthermore, I conducted theoretical and practical courses at the FE in 2021 and 2022, in which students received a two-hour introduction to XR basics and learned about its use-cases in the automotive industry. In addition, students were trained to program their own MR (Mixed Reality) application using the MRTK Unity plugin and the Unity game engine, which would be compatible with Hololens 2. All courses provided students with the opportunity to test XR hardware.

        <h2>Blood rush - infinite runner</h2>
        <p>The ongoing project is a prototype for an infinite runner game, which involves navigating a blood cell within a blood vessel to collect oxygen particles. The player can use collected oxygen to perform a dash, which can eliminate any encountered blood clots. However, if the player collides with a blood clot without dashing, the game ends. Notably, the project incorporates a heartbeat feature that periodically accelerates the blood vessel's movement and a laminar flow that is stronger in the center of the vessel and weaker near the vascular wall.<br><br>
